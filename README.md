This repo is just a code dump of various tests done during the development of BFR robot. Real clean implementation does not exist, and was never written.

- `Core` ESP32 core of the robot (used as main onboard computer to control ESCs)
- `ESC` Arduino motor controllers (one ESC per motor) - Contains code dumps and PCB designs
